title: "Hi! I'm Ryan"

summary: > 
        Since my younger years, Iâ€™ve always been interested in software technologies and 
        their application to everyday life. I frequently pursue independent projects and 
        also engage in the occasional game jam.
        <br />
        <br />
        With interests in automation, software design, and 3D development, I'm open to opportunities with 
        companies that foster professional growth in these areas and will recognize 
        a strong contributor.
